# Data-analysis-With-Python
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to uncover key survival drivers. Using Python visualizations, it examines how gender, class, age, and fare shaped outcomes, delivering clear insights into demographic and socioeconomic survival patterns.
## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/RidwanQamarudeenAbdulazeez/Data-analysis-With-Python/blob/main/titanic.csv"> Dataset<a/>

## Questions (KPIs)
-These key performance indicators (KPIs) guide the analysis:
-What is the overall survival rate?
-How does gender affect survival probability?
-Which passenger class had the highest survival rate?
-Does age influence survival outcomes?
-How is fare associated with survival?
-Do family attributes (SibSp, Parch) correlate with survival?
-What are the relationships among numerical variables?

## Process
Step 1: Data Loading
Imported the Titanic dataset using pandas.
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Handled missing values in the Age column.
Standardized data types.
Converted categorical values into readable formats.
Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Created multiple visualizations to uncover trends:
Bar charts
Grouped bars
Line plots
Boxplots
Violin plots
Scatter plots
Pie charts
Histograms
Correlation heatmaps
Step 4: Interpretation
Interpreted each visualization to extract meaningful insights about survival patterns.
